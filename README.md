## The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.

* A data-page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  * The data came from a `.csv` file and was converted to HTML using Pandas in Python.
  
* The website has a navigation menu at the top of every page that:
  * Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
  * Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
  * Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
  * Is responsive (using media queries). 
  * The website is available by GitHub pages.
